### 1.	Overview of the experience
I used WREC app.

### 2.	Interaction Stories
It's morning, and I'm thinking about taking a nap after my afternoon classes are over. I reserve a nap pod on WELL and head to WREC to participate in group exercise. On the way there, I check today's activities and add one of them to my favorite class. I enter WREC with my member id, search for favorite class, and check the room number. 

Results:
The group exercise information was easy to understand at a glance.
However, it took some time to access the WELL page, so it wasn't a seamless experience.
My member ID couldn't be displayed right away, so I had some trouble at the reception.

### 3.	UX Evaluation
### Pros
•	Simple and Intuitive Design: The homepage is intuitive, easy to read, and allows users to quickly grasp essential information. 

•	Immediate Access to Information: The group exercise page has a well-structured information architecture, reducing cognitive load by displaying only the necessary details (time, location, and exercise type) at a glance.

•	Separation of Favorite Classes: The personalization feature enhances visibility, as favorite classes are stored in a separate section, making them easy to access. 

### Cons
•	Cumbersome Authentication Process: To display the member ID, users must enter their username and password every time they log in, which decreases usability and affects task efficiency. 

•	Fragmented User Flow: Accessing the WELL page requires navigating to another website and logging in again, which disrupts consistency and increases cognitive friction. 

### Suggestions for Improvement
•	Simplify the Login Process: Reduce cognitive load by introducing a “Remember Me” option or biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition). 

•	Integrate WELL Page Access: Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) to ensure seamless navigation across different sections of the platform, improving user flow consistency. 

•	Quick Member ID Display: Enhance visibility by displaying the member ID directly on the dashboard or incorporating a QR code feature for quick access.
